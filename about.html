			<h2>Who We Are</h2>
			<p>The Tea Company was created by a small group of tea-loving indivduals in 2009.</p>
			<p>All of our teas and infusions use top quality tea, herbs, flowers and spices from all over the world. Ranging from gutsy breakfast tea, to delicate white teas to flavoursome green teas and including Rooibos and mint infusions, you can also be assured that all our teas are ethically sourced.</p>
			<p>Our teas are sold at our flagship store, Metrodeco and in keeping with the 1930s Parisian feel of the tea salon we have given them quirky names depicting the style and elegance of a bygone era. Names such as The Devil Is A Woman and Parisian Floral Calm ensure it is not just the taste and quality of our loose leaf teas that that stands out from the crowd, their names will last in your memory too.
